# Overview 

The goal of this assignment is for you to further practice writing software requirements. 

# Instructions: Part 1 

A new home security software project is being developed to support the door-to-door sales team. The team needs a system that can:

* List potential customers using publicly available data (e.g., number of rooms, presence of a garage).
* Help salespeople determine the most suitable security system for each customer using a questionnaire.
* Run on mobile devices with large screens.

Based on this description, create 10 high-level requirements for the sales system:

* 4 user functional requirements (what the system should do for users)
* 4 user non-functional requirements (how well the system should perform)
* 2 system requirements (technical or environmental constraints)

```
