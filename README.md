# Overview 

The goal of this assignment is for you to further practice writing software requirements. 

# Instructions: Part 1 

A new home security software project is being developed to support the door-to-door sales team. The team needs a system that can:

* List potential customers using publicly available data (e.g., number of rooms, presence of a garage).
* Help salespeople determine the most suitable security system for each customer using a questionnaire.
* Run on mobile devices with large screens.

Based on this description, create 10 high-level requirements for the sales system:

* 4 user functional requirements (what the system should do for users)
* 4 user non-functional requirements (how well the system should perform)
* 2 system requirements (technical or environmental constraints)

```
Write your requirements here!
Functional requirements:
User should be notified of questionnaire submissions.
User should be able to tag customers with the most suitable security system.
User should be able to receive an estimation of the costs.
User should be able to search for customers.

Non-functional requirements:
Users should be able to use voice commands for easier access.
Users should be able to have accurate estimation of costs 99.99% of the time.
Users should receive updated data in less than a second.
Users should be able to translate information in different languages.

System requirements:
Software must be able to run on android and ios tablets.
Software must be able to store data for offline usage.
```
